## Introduction

In this post I would like to introduce you the concepts of BGP EVPN from a 100ft view and give you some understanding of what it is and how to get it up and running quickly.

This by no means is a deep-dive on the topic but a way to get started quick and build upon it . I will refer different documents and notes which which I took when I first started learnign this topic. Hope that helps you too.

## Lab Topology

I have used EVE-NG to build this lab out with Nexus 9000v running n9000-i-bin.boot and 2 vCPU and 12GB RAM per instance. The code I am running is 7.0(3)I7(3). Note that the end device are VPCs (Virtual PCs) and not Routers as I had issues with them.

## Methodology

Here's my approach on how I built our the configuration in a layered fashion.

- Build the basic connectivity out (Interfaces,IP Addressing, Routing Protocol Configuration)
- Test basic reachability in the Underlay.
- Configure Overlay Networking and Ensure basic connectivity at swtich level.

Alright so lets get started and start building our EVPN setup piece by piece.

### Building the Basic Configuration Out

Again , since we are doing this in a phased manner , I would enable only the `feature` when it is required so that it would make sense how when and why we are using a given `feature`.


Alright so to begin with since we have to configure the `UNDERLAY` which consists of the SVIs and the Routing we will configure the feaure `interface-vlan` and `ospf`

### Building the Multicast Configuration

- Cover why do we need multicast and characterics of BUM Traffic
- Break out and show where we are using the multicast configuration.
- Configuration without BGP (peer to peer NVE)
- Configuration with BGP (auto peer discovery and mapping)

## Troubleshooting Tips

```sh
root@VTEP-1#tcpdump -i eth8 icmp
tcpdump: WARNING: eth8: no IPv4 address assigned
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth8, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes
09:48:31.589679 IP 172.16.30.10 > 172.16.40.10: ICMP echo request,



show l2 route mac all


show bgp l2vpn evpn
