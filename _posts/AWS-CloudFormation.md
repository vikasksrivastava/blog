JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation"
Used heavility within the AWS Product set
JSON is constructd of name/value pair
Data is seperated by commas
Value can be strin,number,boolean,object,array or null
[] Square brackets holds arrays
Cury Braces {} Holds JSON

Null in its purest form is not used in CloudFormation.

> In the example below notice that the `ProductID` variable is used twice , which is fine since it is under two different JSON objects (Curly Brackets)
**Same variable cannot be used at the same JSON depth**

 ```json

{
"OrderID": 12345,
"ShopperName" : "Reyansh",
"Email": "email@gmail.com",
"OrderData" : [
    {
        "ProductID": "12",
        "Quantity": "1"
    },
    {
        "ProductID":"34",
        "Quantity": 2

    }
]
}

 ```
